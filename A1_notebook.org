*** 7. Copy .tcshrc file from /u/billl/adm/skel (or /u/ericag) into my local home dir 
**** NOT copying .emacs for now (wiki also states that .emacs can be copied from same location as .tcshrc); using unmodified version on local machine
***** *QUESTION*: what will .emacs do to emacs on my local machine? 
****** conversation with @billl:
******* ericaygriffith: bill I have a question -- I mentioned that I got a new linux system. I'm setting it up to mirror neurosim and install everything per the wiki. I'm wondering now what the .emacs file will do to my emacs if I copy that over from neurosim. I'm going through the dot file now, but figured I would ask you what the major points are. do you recommend I import that dot file to my local machine, or just continue using emacs unmodified for now? 
******* billl: you can try with the .emacs and then if that gets too frustrating drop back to unmodified
******* billl: my .emacs 
******* He then sent a .emacs file which is the same as the one I have (currently in ~/Downloads)
******* billl: if you take the one i have above can search for billl and replace -- only main one is (setenv "PYTHONSTARTUP" "/u/billl/adm/pythonrc")

Libraries have been installed in:
   /home/ricky/neuron/iv/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable

**** [python_folder] --> "wherever anaconda or whatever python package you are using is"
***** Does this mean I should install anaconda? 
***** Tried to install anaconda2, but bash .sh wouldn't run. 
***** Tried to follow advice on stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43388956/executing-bash-shell-from-cshell-tcsh), but again got the following error:

***** Now, however, I am seeing that the .sh files are empty when I download them from the site. Realizing I may need to wait for it to finish -- MB size keeps increasing. 
****** Download has now stalled at 337.2 MB 
***** Now I will have /usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3 but I also don't know if that means it is 'installed' -- I suspect not? But at least I will no longer have that message popping up when I open a new terminal?

* <2019-01-16 Wed -- Python install>
** *GOAL*: Fix PATH & PYTHONPATH so that nrniv, nrniv -python work, and anaconda is default python (least important) 
*** *(MISC) BRAINSTORMING*
**** A thought I had -- the first 'error' message I got when opening the terminal, several days ago, was about conda.csh not existing. 
~/usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh: No such file or directory.~
***** What was causing this to try to load this conda.csh file, before I scp'ed anaconda3 from neurosim? Find this out, and may help understand what is going on. 
***** Could it also have to do with NSUF? 
**** Again, the three files in question are:
***** ~/.tcshrc
***** /usr/site/config/csh_defaults
***** /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh

*** *NOTE* anaconda is not default python on laptop 

** Compare PATH & PYTHONPATH to laptop:
*** *NOTE* on laptop, everything specified in .tcshrc file
*** *NOTE* This is before any changes  
*** PYTHONPATH 
**** PYTHONPATH on laptop:
/Applications/NEURON-7.5/nrn/lib/python
**** PYTHONPATH on desktop:
?? See above for various iterations 
*** PATH
**** PATH on desktop:
/usr/site/openmpi-install/bin/
/usr/local/bin
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin
/usr/site/nrniv/iv/x86_64/bin     (*NOTE: DOES NOT EXIST*)

** Deletion-type CHANGES (i.e. get back to baseline):
*** mv /usr/site/nrniv/local/python/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.csh ..
**** close all terminals and reopen to see if the error message from before reappears 
**** IT DOES NOT 
**** Keep this as it is for now, move back later if everything works again
**** moved conda.sh as well, to parent dir, no sign of the message reappearing
*** comment out PYTHONPATH  in /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh AND ~/.tcshrc
**** commented out 1 line in ~/.tcshrc (regular block)
**** commented out 1 line in regular block of nrnenv.csh AND the entire if-else block below it. 
**** DIFFERENCE (*NOTE -- This is with NO CHANGES TO $PATH!*):
***** Now, when doing nrniv on the command line, instead of a long block of text I get: 
Could not load either libnrnpython3 or libnrnpython2
pyver10=0 pylib=/usr/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
***** and nrniv -python gives the same as above plus
Python not available. 
*** comment out PATH 
**** ~/.tcshrc --> commented out lines:
setenv PATH /home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}
set path = ($origpath ...)   *under text input section*
**** /usr/site/config/csh_defaults:
commented out entire initial if-else block
commented out setenv PATH $SITE/openmpi-install/bin:$PATH  *in Open-MPI paths*
**** /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh, commented out:
1x in set path under "Neuron specific variables"
1x in 2nd to last if-else block, in 1st 'if'
1x in same if-else block, in 2nd 'else', 2nd time of set path (1st was already commented out) 
**** ~/.bashrc, commented out:
export PATH=/home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:$PATH
entire conda block at the bottom 

** CHANGE PATH & PYTHONPATH TO BE EQUIVALENT TO LAPTOP:
*** STARTING FROM NO PYTHONPATH on desktop
*** STARTING FROM PATH (on desktop):
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
*** *NOTE* python default is no longer anaconda, and nrniv is command not found 
*** Changes to PYTHONPATH on desktop:
**** The equivalent to laptop PYTHONPATH may be: =/home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python= 
**** Changed ~/.tcshrc to include setenv PYTHONPATH /home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python
**** With PATH as stated above, nrniv is still command not found, etc. (same as *NOTE* above)  
**** CHANGE #2: equivalent may in fact be /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python
**** CHANGE #3: in ~/.tcshrc, modifying PYTHONPATH so it also includes:
setenv PYTHONPATH /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python:/usr/site/../arch/nrn/share/nrn/lib/python
***** Commented out the above change
***** Below it, wrote =setenv PYTHONPATH /usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python=
*** Changes to PATH on desktop: 
**** Comparing to PATH on laptop, may need the following:
***** /usr/site/nrniv/local/bin  (*recall difference btwn linux & os x with /usr/local*)
****** I think nrnivmodl should be in here? 
****** But I do have mkmod!
***** [neuron_folder]/x86_64/bin ??????? --> /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin 
****** /home/ricky/neuron/nrn/ does not have these subdirs 
****** Look to list of dirs in original desktop PATH above to see if there are equivalents
******* /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin --> has nrniv! 
******* Set PATH to include this in ~/.tcshrc 
******* Where did it ORIGINALLY come from?  --> potentially /usr/site/nrniv/simctrl/nrnenv.csh
***** [DONE] /usr/local/bin
***** [DONE] /usr/bin
***** [DONE] /bin
***** [DONE] /usr/sbin
***** [?] /usr/local/sbin, /usr/games, /usr/local/games, /snap/bin (*on desktop but not laptop*)

** OTHER CHANGES:
COMMENTING OUT NEURONHOME in .tcshrc, along with 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
HOC_LIBRARY_PATH

** At the end of the day, default python is python2.7, can't do nrniv or nrniv -python, but does recognize the command. Give it a rest for tonight. 

* <2019-01-17 Thu -- Python install (final)>
** [DONE] Fixing PATH & PYTHONPATH so nrniv and nrniv -python will work
*** Starting PATH & PYTHONPATH
**** PATH
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
**** PYTHONPATH
/usr/site/../arch/nrn/lib/python:/usr/site/../arch/nrn/share/nrn/lib/python
***** This is according to both appendix F and the section after the cloning (installing NEURON)

*** PATH edits:
**** adding to ~/.tcshrc:
***** =setenv PATH ..... :/home/ricky/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}= --> according to Appendix F  
***** now, default python is anaconda2 

*** PYTHONPATH edits: 
**** adding to ~/.tcshrc:
***** =setenv PYTHONPATH .....:/home/ricky/neuron/nrn/share/lib/python= 

*** Re-do this installation with neuron not in ~/neuron/nrn, but instead in /usr
**** [DONE] That would require unsetting the PATH & PYTHONPATH in ~/.tcshrc for now 
**** Using wiki (instructions for installing Neurosim NEURON), but in the NEURON & Python2.7 installation in the HPC ('ma') section
**** First, install anaconda 
***** should I get rid of anaconda2 in ~/anaconda2? [yes - do this for now w/ rm -r ~/anaconda2]
***** mv Anaconda2..... /usr/site/nrniv/Anaconda2.....
***** cd /usr/site/nrniv
***** bash Anaconda2etc.sh (answered 'yes' to prompt, and set install location to /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2)
***** said 'yes' to initializing anaconda2 in .bashrc 
****** check bashrc for difference: yes, there is stuff at the end there 
***** close terminals & re-open 
***** echo $PATH and $PYTHONPATH remain as expected -- no PYTHONPATH yet and PATH is only defaults 
***** in ~/.tcshrc, added =setenv PATH /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2/bin:${PATH}=
***** echo $PATH now includes the above directory 
***** which python --> /usr/site/nrniv/anaconda2/bin/python
***** python --version --> Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc.
***** moved back anaconda.sh file to ~/Downloads
**** Next, setup for InterViews & NEURON installation:
***** Removed neuron from ~/neuron --> =rm -r ~/neuron=
***** cd /usr/site/nrniv
***** *DO NOT EXIST?* hg clone /nrn and /iv from repos as specified in wiki 
***** *WILL THIS SCREW ANYTHING UP?* git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn (& iv directory), as specified in Compiling & Installing Neuron using Neurosim paths 
***** setenv NRDIR /usr/site
***** setenv NSRC $NRDIR/nrniv/nrn
***** setenv IVB $NRDIR/nrniv/iv
***** setenv NB $NRDIR/nrniv/nrn/x86_64 --> *NOTE* there is no last slash in wiki... assuming there has to be one there, so adding it in? nrnx86_64 doesn't make much sense???
***** setenv ND $NRDIR/../arch/nrn

**** Install Interviews

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/nrniv/iv/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/site/../arch/nrn/x86_64/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.

*** (0) What to do w/ the directories that already exist? -- Nothing for now? 
**** (a) the ones w/ corresponding repos on laptop & NEUROSIM
**** (b) the ones w/out corresponding repos, and only directories on laptop  
*** (1) Now that I have cell classification data, organize the data files on laptop according to these categories 
*** (2) Extract the properties of several from each category 
**** First determine what properties are relevant
**** Then determine how to extract -- matlab?
**** Average the properties, as appropriate
**** How to deal with passive optimization? 
*** (3) Create directories (repos) for each cell type (see above for protocol on this)  
*** (4) Think about the math -- evaluate each in terms of phase plane analysis; confer w/ Matt Garcia

****** Double-spiking cells w/ varying degrees of excitability (higher current required)
**** MA projection neurons
**** PV IN 
**** VIP IN

*** Transfer relevant data files from laptop onto desktop
**** Made a new dir on desktop: ~/Desktop/claustrum_data --> moving to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/claustrum_data
**** This dir contains all the housekeeping files related to Martin's data. 
**** Current contents: 
***** *for_erica.xlsx* -- This is the original large excel file given to me by Martin, which has info on old / new ID, properties for each cell, and some graphs of the 11AP sorting.
***** *cell_type_list.xlsx* -- Given to me by Martin around 1/24/19 listing the main cell type groups and the new/old ID of each cell within each group.  
***** *abf_files_by_cellType.docx* -- Generated by me to reconcile abf names from for_erica.xlsx with the old/new ID information given to me on cell_type_list.xlsx

** Create Repository Structure 
*** How should this work? OPTIONS:
**** Archive claus repos on laptop & NEUROSIM 
**** On desktop -- what should be the parent directory? ~/Desktop or ~/Documents? Going for ~/Desktop 
**** So what should be the next step down from ~/Desktop? Should each cell type have its own directory? I feel like this is what makes the most sense. So if that's the case, to avoid it ballooning out of control, I will create a directory called ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM, and keep everything in there. 
*** First deal with desktop to NEUROSIM workflow: 
**** Made directory: ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/ which will contain work-related files
**** Moved claustrum_data to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/claustrum_data --> this is not a git repository
**** Made 2 cell type dirs (on desktop): 
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1
****** Corresponding dir on NEUROSIM: /u/ericag/SA1 
****** Corresponding dir on laptop: ~/Desktop/
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2
****** Corresponding dir on laptop: ~/Desktop/
****** Corresponding dir on NEUROSIM: /u/ericag/SA2 
**** Initialized both cell type dirs as git repositories (git init) 
**** Edited config file in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1 & ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2 
**** Created 2 cell type dirs on NEUROSIM: 
***** /u/ericag/SA1 (along with /u/ericag/SA1_bare)
***** /u/ericag/SA2 (along with /u/ericag/SA2_bare) 
**** Initialized both cell type dirs on NEUROSIM as git repositories (git init) 
**** Initialized both cell type bare directories on NEUROSIM as bare repos (git init --bare)

*** Now deal with laptop to NEUROSIM workflow:
**** Made 2 cell type directories: 
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA1
***** ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/SA2 
**** Initialized both using git (git init)
**** Edited config files of each via SourceTree (Repositories --> Repository Settings --> Remotes --> Add --> name: origin, url: ssh://ericag@no.neurosim.downstate.edu/u/ericag/SA1_bare)
*** *NOTE* Got rid of test_repo on desktop & NEUROSIM 
*** So, now desktop, laptop, and NEUROSIM all have SA1 and SA2 repositories linked to SA1_bare and SA2_bare on NEUROSIM. 
* <2019-02-05 Tue -- A1 model>
** A1 repo notes:
*** NOTE: Focus is on A1 for now since ~fastest progress can be made (setting aside S1 for now)
*** samn A1 repo: https://bitbucket.org/samnemo/mtla1/src/default/
*** Preliminary model for A1 -- will move to NEUROSIM later
*** In bitbucket repo, samn says that the useful parts will be to "take some of the *cell types* and *connectivity params* + *size of cortical layers*, which differ in nonhuman primates (much bigger L2/L3) compared to rodents"

** Cell Types:
*** Bill says that the cell types should be the same as Fig. 1 in M1 paper:

** email from mgraf about filename structure: 
Hi Erica,

oh no sorry, i know the file names are  a mess to deal with. 
If i am not wrong you have all most abf files- at least the "old ID" abf files, right ? (should be around 380). SO they are accessible and the file name in the raw data abf folder corresponds to the "old ID". In the second tab with the abf file overview in your excel sheet, this old ID corresponds to the second number. So if you want to access a particular file that you find in the raw data overview, you need to check the 2nd number, go to the file folder and find c96 (c96 is the first cell in the dendrogram and has the new ID 59 and is on position 1).

Adi files are labelled as Axx and can be found in the Adi abf folder, "RC" files are retrobead labelled cells- I think those files you might not have.

The confusion comes from my decision to not label the raw abf files according to the "NEW ID" otherwise I had to relabel raw files...and as we went trough many different iterations of classification, it would have meant to relabel all abf files with each new iteration- so the new ID is to unify the names but you have to look at older ID tags to access the files in their respective older abf folders.

Messy but until we had a stable classification scheme I didnt want to rename everything... probably should for the sake of anyone else than me that has to work with the files. Will do it when I have some more time.

Best regards,
Martin

P.S> With that explanation, you should be able to find the files. NEW ID to find location in dendrogram, old ID to find abf file in abf-file folder. 

P.S.S> Do you have all raw abf files??

* <2019-03-08 Fri - A1 parameterization>
** PARAMETERS CHANGED TODAY:
*** Now have normalized layer boundaries
**** Normalized layer boundaries taken from original A1 github repo
**** now in netParams 
**** NOTE: Layer V has two parts --> E5R: 1250-1334 (0.625-0.667), E5B: 1334-1550(0.667-0.775)
*** Shape of column?? Unfinished, see below:  
**** cfg.sizeX, cfg.sizeY, cfg.sizeZ -- for M1 they are 400, 1350, 400. 
**** debate on slack: 
samn [1:56 PM]
is 1350 enough to span all layers with the params given for electrode locations?
400 x 400 ... maybe can look up radius for the electrodes used ... but can start with 400x400 for x,z

billl [1:57 PM]
we doing monkey here right? -- so wil be bigger
but that's another reason for using NCD (yfrac) since can maintain proportionality

samn [1:58 PM]
NCD sounds ok, have the layer sizes too from peter's placement
based on functional (responses to sounds)

samn [2:01 PM]
i emailed peter to ask ~radius from electrode

billl [2:01 PM]
in terms of the LFP spread? -- that's not really known is it?

samn [2:02 PM]
those numbers for layer sizes were given
based on his electrode placement

billl [2:02 PM]
guess could look at einevoll papers to see what they think

samn [2:02 PM]
not known - probably not exactly but might have estimates, yeah einevoll good

**** the size of the column will (eventually?) match up with what we are able to measure with a given electrode -- the electrode radius / LFP spread will help us get the area of the cylinder face, then the height should match up with the height of the layers. 
**** bill says to keep it simple for now, and samn agrees but wants to get the info anyway just to scale up if needed. 
*** netParams.popParams:
**** Essentially copied M1 netParams https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne/blob/development/examples/M1detailed/netParams.py, lines 210-225. 
**** However, did not fill in cellModel label, and kept ynormRange label values consistent w/ the layer dict described above (on line 62 currently) 
** [did not do] Look at pre-processing from Salva M1: 
*** conn.py, conn_long.py, conn_dend.py -- on neurosim -- check these files for M1 densities & to see pre-processing steps 
** QUESTIONS FOR SALVA: 
*** (1) for cellType in popParams --> where do IT, PT, SOM, PV, CT get defined? where is their 'cellRule'? 
*** (2) What is the deal with the reduced cells, etc around line 58, 80, etc. 

** Version Control:
*** scp lab nb to neurosim

** list of netParams.cellParams in netParams.py (line 63, M1_detailed)
*** *NOTE*: all this info is specified in the pkl file 
*** *NOTE*: the netParams.cellParams object keeps track of the cell rules which apply to the conditions specified in the cell rules 
*** IT5A_full: IT, HH_full, 0.42-0.52
*** IT2_reduced: IT, HH_reduced, 0.12-0.31

*** PV_simple: PV, HH_simple, no depth listed

*** PT5B_full: commented out 
*** *NOTE*: so, in popParams, whatever cells match the conditions set out in these rules will have the characteristics specified by the contents of the appropriate .pkl file. 
*** *NOTE*: SHOULD I CHANGE THESE DEPTHS? 

** Changes made today
*** changed cfg.scale = 2000.0 in cfg.py (under 'Network' section) bc seems like this is the total height specified by the layers info in the original A1 github repo -- check w/ Sam? 
*** Uncommented "General connectivity parameters" in netParams.py -- taking values from M1detailed 

** Parameters / Variables I need to define:
*** in netParams.py
**** netParams.scale = cfg.scale # Scale factor for number of cells
**** All general connectivity parameters (scaleConnWeight, etc. all the way to propLambda -- currently lines 44-50 under section "General connectivity parameters")
**** *QUESTION*: where do (line 45) netParams.scaleConnWeightModels dict labels called 'HH_simple', 'HH_reduced', and 'HH_full' get defined & used? 

*** in cfg.py
**** cfg.scale (under 'Network' (currently the last section))
**** cfg.scaleDensity 

** QUESTIONS FOR SAMN, SALVA, ETC:
*** should cfg.sizeY be set to 2000 since that is the total height we are working with re: the layers?
*** What should cfg.scale be set to? (cfg.py)
*** What should cfg.scaleDensity be set to? (cfg.py)
*** Should the 'general connectivity parameters' in netParams.py be set to the same values as M1 detailed? (Uncommented for now). 
*** In 'General connectivity parameters' --> HH_simple, HH_reduced, and HH_full are listed as dict labels in scaleConnWeightModels --> where do these get defined, used, etc.? 
*** For layer dict in netParams.py, I use the layer info specified by orig A1 github repo. There is also a boundary in M1 layer 5, similarly to A1 layer 5 -- the cell types in layer 5 are divided up in M1 -- should I use these cell devisions in A1 too? Word this better.

*** Put in cells for everything except for the ambiguous layers (IT5A, SOM5A, PV5A, IT5B, PT5B, SOM5B, PV5B) 

** Added cellDensity.pkl to A1/cells subdirectory, to load densities
** Connectivity: 
*** possibly use Sacha's file? 
*** use simplified M1? 
*** have to use a model with cell types similar to ours
** Re-read cortical microcircuit model paper 
** Getting to the bottom of the SOM_simple and PV_simple cell params objects, and by which populations they are used
*** commented out (in M1 detailed netParams.py), the PT5B_full block bc it is giving me hoc syntax errors when loading PTcell.hoc 
*** Yup, SOM_simple and PV_simple do not have depth requirements

** QUESTIONS TO ANSWER TOMORROW:
*** What to do about layer 5 / 45A?
*** should cfg.sizeY be set to 2000 vs 1350 because that is the height we are working with? 
*** Should cfg.scaleDensity in cfg.py be set to 0.01 like in M1_detailed? --> doing this for now
*** What about cfg.scale? 
*** Keep general connectivity params same as M1? 
*** Should I use the same cellDensity.pkl file as in M1?  --> doing this for now 
*** Should I use the same synaptic mechanism parameters as in M1 netParams.py? 
** *NOTE*: the cells subdir has NOT YET BEEN ADDED -- FIGURE THIS OUT TOMORROW 

* <2019-03-13 Wed -- Adding in A1 cell types from M1>
** Added cells subdir to my A1 git repo (on NEUROSIM, github, laptop, desktop) 
** Compare M1 (netpyne, salva) and A1 layers (orig samn git repo) and cell types:
*** Layer I [none]
*** Layer II:
**** A1 -- E2, I2, I2L
**** M1 -- IT2 (excitatory), SOM2, PV2 
*** Layer III [none]
*** Layer IV:
**** A1 -- E4, I4, I4L 
**** M1 -- IT4 (excitatory) 
*** Layer IV + top 1/2 of Layer V:
**** A1 -- none
**** M1 -- SOM5A, PV5A (both inhibitory)  
*** Layer V (entire layer):
**** A1 -- I5, I5L 
**** M1 -- none
*** Layer V (top section):
**** A1 -- E5R
**** M1 -- IT5A
*** Layer V (bottom section):
**** A1 -- E5B
**** M1 -- IT5B, PT5B (both excitatory), SOM5B, PV5B (both inhibitory) 
*** Layer VI:
**** A1 -- E6, I6, I6L
**** M1 -- IT6, CT6 (both excitatory); SOM6, PV 6 (both inhibitory) 

** Visual comparison of the above reveals that the major difference is that the bottom section of layer 5 & the entirety of layer 6 have 2 excitatory populations each (vs. 1 excitatory population observed in A1)

** Version control 
*** edited netParams.py in A1 on laptop 
*** to NEUROSIM
*** to GITHUB
*** to DESKTOP -- did not version control to desktop!!!

* <2019-03-14 Thu -- A1 cell types>
** Conclusion for cell types was to keep each layer w/ separately named cell populations. 
** Additional conclusion re: inhibitory pops in layers 5b & 6 was ambiguouts: 
*** see slack #auditory from 3/13/19 
** Get something running -- even if partial 
** Added all cell types from layer 5A and layer 5B and inhib populations from layer 4 
*** right now that means layer 2, 4, and 5A have 1 excitatory IT pop and 2 inhibitory pops (SOM and PV)
*** layer 5B has 2 excitatory pops (IT & PT) and 2 inhib (SOM & PV)
*** layer 6 has 2 excitatory pops (IT & CT) and 2 inhib (SOM & PV)
*** using density.pkl as it came in M1 detailed 
** Edited pkl files to change cell boundary layers remaining cell type files:
*** what was done so far: IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl, IT4_reduced, IT6_reduced 
*** [done] CT6_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.77 to 1.0  --> 0.775 to 1.0 (3 times)
*** IT5A_full_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.42 - 0.52 --> 0.625 - 0.667 (3 times) 
*** IT5A_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** Changed from 0.42-0.52 to 0.625-0.667 (3 times) 
*** IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** changed from 0.52-0.77 --> 0.667-0.775
*** PT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl:
**** changed from 0.52-0.77 --> 0.667-0.775 (3 times) 

** Added new subdir mod for mod files
*** Added MyExp2SynBB.mod & MyExp2SynNMDABB.mod 
*** must compile these mod files

** Sent email to Alan (yueyang) about optimization
** Stimulation for A1 model:
*** per cortex meeting: use white noise NetStim inputs as in M1
*** There are two sections in M1 netParams.py that I think have to do with inputs:
**** Current inputs (IClamp)
**** NetStim inputs 
**** Which of the above do I use? In meeting, NetStim was what was said, but look through the code to see what each does. 
**** added NetStim inputs section in cfg.py
** Added sections for current inputs & NetStim inputs in cfg.py & netParams.py 
** Connection scheme for A1 model:
*** Other models w/ cell types similar to us? 
*** Sacha? 
*** M1? 
** Find VIP interneuron info
** Find Layer I interneuron info 
** Other notes from meeting: keep general connectivity params the same (in netParams.py) until better data available

** Added NetStim inputs to every population in cfg.py 
*** This is under 'NetStim inputs' section of cfg.py 
*** cfg.NetStim1 thru cfg.NetStim17 because samn says that we should have background white noise input to every population
*** The keys/values of the cfg.NetStim dicts:
**** pop
**** ynorm -- [0,1]
**** sec -- 'soma' (should these all be 'soma'?)
**** loc -- '0.5' (should these all be 0.5?)
**** synMech -- 'AMPA' (should these all be AMPA?)
**** synMechWeightFactor -- [1.0]
**** start -- changing this from 500 to 0 
**** interval -- 1000.0/60.0
**** noise -- 0.0
**** number -- 60.0 (number of what? samn: "number of inputs") 
***** may change this to be the number of cells so inputs:cells goes 1:1? 
**** weight -- 30.0 (?)
**** delay -- 0
**** the values above indicate the first-pass test values, all grabbed from M1 odel (cfg.py) 

*** I made one NetStim per population (cfg.NetStim01, cfg.NetStim02, ... , cfg.NetStim 17) 
** Commeted out all text in IClamp section of netParams.py (A1) bc IClamp will not be used for now.

** Changed cfg.analysis['plotRaster'] so instead of just 'True' it reads: cfg.analysis['plotRaster'] = {'include': allpops, 'saveFig': True, 'showFig': True} --> testing now
** Made the weights in NetStim 10 (from 30), per samn's suggestion. Believe he thinks the synchrony in the firing is due to the inputs being too strong, but actually I think it's probably because I made them that way w/ the netstim values in cfg.py 
** *NOTE*: samn says that we will readjust the (frequency of) the inputs once the cells themselves are readjusted ("L5 pyramidal neurons have dendrites reaching into upper layers (1/2/3)")
** Next: Layer I interneurons (VIP?) & connection data

*** L1 interneurons important for setting circuit's phase (particularly important for inputs from pulvinar and thalamic relay matrix inputs):
**** samn [10:38 AM]
and again about the *importance of L1 interneurons, particularly for inputs from pulvinar and thalamic relay matrix inputs, important for setting circuit's phase*
a few days ago they did some experiments with lidocaine in thalamus, lidocaine apparently blocks ih...just mentioning since they're moving towards using targeted pharmacological manipulation of specific channels/populations and seeing if can dissect more info. on interneuron circuitry

** Had meeting today in #isb channel:
*** Read the following papers on L1 interneurons & circuitry:
**** 4 interneuron populations reside in neocortical layer 1
**** Potjans & Diesmann 
**** neocortical circuit: themes and variations 
**** inhibitory L5 paper 
**** interneurons of the neocort inhibitory system -- markram et al 
**** learning-related plasticity in dendrite-targeting L1 interneurons 
**** rapid neuromodulation of L1 interneurons
**** syn computatino & sensory processing in neocortical L2/3 
*** Figure out which 'class' of interneuron (VIP, SOM, PV) the NDNF interneurons belong in (probably VIP) in order to facilitate model building (potentially)
*** Feeling overwhelmed with respect to the interneuron stuff so maybe it would be helpful for me to just write out what I'm thinking? 
**** I don't know where to go to find the VIP interneurons. I guess I could go to modeldb, especially now that I know it doesn't matter if they are macaque or not, and just find one that is in NEURON. Then go to neuro-electro in order to modify for macaque. 
**** with respect to L1 -- read those papers in order to get a better sense of wtf is going on in terms of: electrophysiology & connectivity. Then I need to create a L1 interneuron population. How to do this? Steal some other interneuron stuff based on what 'category' they fall into (VIP?) and then modify based on the papers I'm reading... think that sounds like a plan. 
**** also wrt L1 -- look for models in the literature, even if not published
**** also look on BBP and HBP for models of either VIP or L1 interneurons 
*** RE: classifying the L1 interneurons based on their properties, pay attention to connectivity as well as GABA-synapse time constants 
** Harris & Sheperd 2015 (Themes and Variations) notes:
*** *EXCITATORY*:
*** Table 1 provides a summary of inputs / outputs of major excitatory cell classes
*** Figure 1 provides decent summary/diagram of where cells project to locally 
*** thalamic inputs to auditory cortex: 
**** "core-type axons from the ventral part of the MGN project to L4 and the L5/6 border"
**** "matrix-type afferents from dorsal & medial MGN project to layer 1 and subgranular layers but avoid L4" --> layer 1!! to the interneurons? 
**** refs: 26, 27 
*** L4 IT neurons: pyramidal, star-pyramidal, spiny stellate (spiny stellate are generally absent in A1! -- ref 45) 
*** thalamocortical inputs -- L4 in primary sensory regions receives 'massive core-type thalamic input but very few inputs from other thalamic or cortical areas"
*** [in A1] "L4 processing of TC inputs appears to depend critically on the precise timing of excitation and inhibition" ... "TC inputs excite not only L4 IT interneurons but also interneurons, resulting in rapid and powerful feedforward inhibition of ECs" (refs 51, 52) ... "because this inhibition arrives with a slight delay relative to excitation, it creates a narrow 'window of opportunity' for ECs to fire an accurately timed spike; furthermore, stimulus-dependent differences in the timing of excitatory input allow L4 IT neurons to respond selectively to specific stimuli." (refs 53, 54)
*** Essentially, circuitry of TC / intracortical circuits are tuned to create RECEPTIVE FIELDS in L4 neurons 
*** FIGURE 4 givews a good connectivity diagram of IT cells 
*** L4 IT neurons tend to be unidirectional (input from thalamus, output to other IT cells mostly)
*** Other IT cells have more bidirectional signaling
*** ALL POPS HAVE RECURRENT CONNECTIONS WITH CELLS IN THAT SAME POPULATION 
*** L6 IT may project to claustrum!! 
*** *INHIBITORY*
*** refs: 13, 116-118 for classification 
*** Most upstream: VIP (5HT3ra class) -- most abundant in L2/3
*** ^^ "narrowly-focused descending axon, a trait shared with lower L1 interneurons (single-bouquet cells"
*** ^^ both of these cell types receive strong excitatory input from cortico-cortical axons in L1 AND from local ECs (?) refs: 120, 123-125
*** ^^ bothy have ionotropic receptors for acetylcholine (nicotinic AChR) and serotonin 
*** Fig 6 has good info on directionality of inhibition 
*** VIP & L1 single-bouquet --| SST interneuron (--| EC dendrites) & PV basket cells (--| EC soma)  
*** "In A1.. locomotion decreases sensory responses in L2/3 IT & PV neurons... locomotion again increases activity of A1 VIP cells, which again inhibit SST & PV interneurons." (?) [evidently OPPOSITE of V1 even though hodology is conserved] 
*** Table 2 gives summary of interneuron types 
*** Where are the interneurons located, layer-wise? all of them in all layers? 
** Markram et al. 2003 (Interneurons of the Neocortical Inhibitory System):
*** "[Different classes of] interneurons are particularly specialized to target different domains of neurons (e.g. soma, dendrites), different layers of a column, and different columns." 
*** Fig 1 gives a summary of this domain-targeting difference. 
**** (combined with info from last paper):
**** NGF -- dendrite-targeting
**** Basket (PV) -- soma & proximal-dendrite targeting
**** Chandelier (PV) -- axon-targeting 
**** Martinotti (SST) -- dendrite & tuft-targeting 
**** Categories from prev paper not mention in Fig 1: VIP & L4 SST 
*** Most of this data is coming from RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX 
*** Fig 2 gives approximate percentages of different Inhibitory cell types in Layers II-VI 
*** *Basket cells* -- typically *PV* cells (consistent w/ Harris & Sheperd 2015), and since they synapse on somata & proximal dendrites, evidently they are well-positioned to modulate the 'gain' of the integrated synaptic response (? -- still don't understand gain fully). 3 different types:
**** Large (never VIP) -- large, aspiny, multipolar dendrites. often multipolar but can be bitufted, pyramidal or bipolar. 
**** small (sometimes VIP, and some weird stuff going on w/ layer 4 -- often multipolar in L4 and bipolar or bitufted in L2/3) 
**** nest (never VIP) 
*** *Chandelier cells* -- typically *PV* cells (consistent w/ Harris & Sheperd), found in L2-L6 
**** Found in L2-L6
**** multipolar or bitufted
**** axonal synaptic location allows for powerful control due to direct 'editing' ability on AP output 
*** *Martinotti cells* -- always *SOM* (consistent) 
**** Found in L2-L6
**** project axons towards *layer 1*, where they "inhibit the tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons" (Fig 1, supp) 
**** also project horizontally in layer 1, allowing for cross-columnar inhibition via L1 
**** Infragranular MCs (L5/6?) can selectively targe L4 
**** usually bitufted w/ more elaborate dendritic tree 
*** *Bipolar cells* -- typically *VIP* (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd; VIP subclasses not addressed)
**** Occur in L2-L6 
**** small cells w/ spindle or ovoid somata
**** (bipolar or bitufted) dendrites extend twds L1 and down to L6 
**** excitatory if releasing VIP and inhibitory by releasing GABA 
*** *Double bouquet cells* -- typically *VIP* (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd)
**** bitufted dendritic morphology 
**** occur in L2-L6
**** "in primates... interleaved wit pyramidal cells to inhibit their basal dendrites"
**** mainly dendritic targeting cells 
*** *Bitufted cells* -- can be *VIP* *SOM* but not PV (not mentioned in Harris & Sheperd) 
**** found in L2-L6
*** *NGF* -- not well studied
*** *L1 interneurons* -- not well-studied (2 groups noted here) 
**** Cajal Retzius cells -- large, multipolar w/ horizontal processes, present mostly during development
**** Heterogeneous group of small, multipolar interneurons w/ various axonal arborizations
*** Electrical types (refined, but not taking into account steady-state responses yet):
**** LTS --> L5, Martinotti (SST, consistent w/ H&S) and Double-bouquet (typically VIP)
**** RSNP --> L2/3 & L5, Martinotti (SST), Double-bouquets (typically VIP), bipolar cells (typically VIP)
**** LS --> L2/3 & L5, NGCs (neurogliaform, consistent with H&S)
**** IS (irregular) --> L2/3 & L5, bipolar cells (typically VIP)
**** VIP cells thus mostly regular & late spiking, with some amount of irregular spiking 
*** The rest of this paper may get too granular -- skim it again tomorrow then move on. 
** FOR TOMORROW -- need to look for VIP interneuron model from any species, verify that it looks vaguely okay electrophysiologically, then look on neuro-electro & at more literature & BBP/HBP to find electro properties of macaque VIP and substitute with that. (If connectivity can be used as a criteria then sure, need to determine connectivity patterns in the literature then look at connectivity patterns in the available model(s); need to also look at time constants in the literature and neuro-electro and whatnot, and make sure that data is reflected in the model or in my modifications of the model). 
** Same applies for layer 1 interneurons -- read more about them in the literature. decide how to proceed later (look at HBP/BBP and at literature for models. or look at what they are closest to -- NGF VIP? how do they differ?) 
   
* <2019-03-28 Thu -- VIP interneuron search>
** (1) get VIP model from modeldb:
https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=246546&file=/Turi_et_al_2018/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc#tabs-2
** (2) Modify compartments so down from ~15 to ~5ish:
*** Load in cell and see what firing is like at different current injections
*** Reduce compartments and see how it changes 

** (3) Modify w/ data about macaque VIP:
*** info from neuroelectro:
*** info from literature: 
** Downloaded vipcr_cell.hoc on Desktop into ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc 
** Next: look at firing pattern by loading cell into neuron/netpyne 
** Testing VIP CR cell:
*** Added to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/mod/:
**** nafcr.mod
**** kdrcr.mod
**** ikscr.mod
**** iccr.mod
**** vipcr_cell.hoc imports kadcr -- > NOT seeing a .mod file for this in the modeldb repo
**** cancr.mod
**** cadyn.mod --> NOT replaced (there is one there already), keep this
*** Compiled mod files
*** Error regarding lambda_f:

0.0

>>> lambda_f = 100

>>> h.load_file('cells/vipcr_cell.hoc')

1.0
*** samn says to define it in the .hoc file, so I added lambda_f = 100 as the very top line per hoc documentation 
*** Error w/ importing Nafcr:
**** changed to insert nafcr because modfile is nafcr.mod 
**** changed gnarbar_Nafcr to gnafbar_nafcr for same reason 
**** changed back because in nafcr.mod it is capitalized 
**** changed name of mod file to Nafcr.mod -- changed back
**** okay back to original everything... why is this happening? 
**** fixed by re-compiling everything (deleting symbolic link in main A1 dir first though : rm -f x86_64) 
** VIP_test_orig.py (in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1): file will load the original vipcr_cell.hoc file 
** Version control:
*** Github
**** go to A1_bare on neurosim

*** Laptop
*** Desktop (done -- working from desktop)
*** Lab_NB 
**** desktop (done)
**** laptop

** Now changed original vip cell hoc file to vipcr_cell_orig.hoc and changed this in VIP_test_orig.py as well [[tested & works]] 
** I made a copy of this .hoc file and it is named vipcr_cell.hoc and this is what I will be editing! 

** Created a copy of the VIP test python file and named it *VIP_test_edited.py* and it imports *vipcr_cell.hoc* from /cells in order to work. /tested/ --> runs 


   
** Suggestion from Salva & samn regarding compartments: 
samn [10:39 AM] 
public soma
public radProx1, radMed1, radDist1, lmM1, lmt1
public radProx2, radMed2, radDist2, lmM2, lmt2
public oriProx1, oriMed1, oriDist1
public oriProx2, oriMed2, oriDist2

salvadord [10:39 AM]
so ~15 comps… maybe can reduce to those main labels: soma, rad, lm, ori ? whatever those mean…ç

** What is the current organization / shape of the cell? --> soma w/ 4 protrusions 


** Version control so can work on laptop -- before leaving for downstate this afternoon! 
*** desktop --> neurosim
**** git add & commit 
**** git push ssh://ericag@no.neurosim.downstate.edu/u/ericag/A1_bare

** @ downstate --> commented out basic shape pt3dadd lines, and got rid of all original compartment names and replaced them with rad1, rad2, ori1, and ori2, which I made by essentially collapsing all of the former compartments together. 

** TOMORROW: test out new vipcr_cell.hoc with different diameters for the new compartments and compare to original firing rate / pattern, scp lab_notebook.org into all the right places (desktop has most recent copy, so laptop and neurosim)
* <2019-03-29 Fri -- testing VIP interneuron>
** Changed synapses in vipcr_cell.hoc (recall vipcr_cell_orig.hoc is the original .hoc file):
*** synapses: 
**** AMPA EC: lmM1 & lmM2 --> rad1 & rad2
**** AMPA CA3 Shaffer: radMed1, radMed2, radProx1, radProx2 --> rad1 & rad2
**** AMPA PC: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2
**** GABA-A Septum: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2
**** GABA-B Septum: oriProx1, oriProx2 --> ori1 & ori2 
*** For the above, I should note the original location of these synapses on the new consolidated compartments --> commented in vipcr_cell.hoc file 
** Works/ w new synapse configuration.

** Seems like new edited version of the VIP CR cell is less excitable (see above), etc. but put it in the model for now and then continue adjusting after we establish connectivity, since we may have to adjust lengths of dendrites, etc. 
** On DESKTOP computer (princess putey), I moved VIP_test_orig.py and the VIP_test_figs directory to the archived_files directory (will do the same with VIP_test_edited.py once I put the VIP cells into the model -- want to use it as a reference first)

** QUESTIONS ABOUT VIP in model:
*** Should I save this as a pkl file like the other cells? If so, how? 
**** salva says to set netParams.saveCellParams to True 
**** Try this in VIP_test.py first 
**** saveCellParams = True did not work --> seems obvious; what would this even do?

** TASK 1: VIP pkl file -- conclusion: VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl in cells subdir  
*** Lines 68-74 in netParams.py name all the populations of cells and then load their .pkl files 
*** Figure out how to get VIP pkl file like the rest of them 
*** Salva says: 'check the m1 netParams — when the flag `saveCellParams` is set to true it calls a func to save the params to a pkl file'
*** in A1/netParams.py --> adding saveCellParams = True
*** Already did this in A1/VIP_test/VIP_netParams.py --> but was this enough? WHAT gets saved w/ this saveCellParamsRule
*** There exists (UNCOMMITTED, on DESKTOP), two files in A1/cells which were saved via the above script to .pkl files. But are they correct? 
*** Try using what M1 model does for SOM & PV 
**** e.g. ## SOM cell params (3-comp) -- lines 187-193 in M1detailed/netParams.py 
if 'SOM_simple' not in loadCellParams:
    cellRule = netParams.importCellParams(label='SOM_simple', conds={'cellType':'SOM', 'cellModel':'HH_simple'}, 
      fileName='cells/LTS3.hoc', cellName='LTScell1', cellInstance = True)
    cellRule['secLists']['spiny'] = ['soma', 'dend']
    netParams.addCellParamsWeightNorm('SOM_simple', 'conn/SOM_simple_weightNorm.pkl', threshold=cfg.weightNormThreshold)
    netParams.saveCellParamsRule(label='SOM_simple', fileName='cells/SOM_simple_cellParams.pkl')
**** Changed all instances of SOM to VIP and commented out cellRule['secLists...] and netParams.addCellParamsWeight... lines 
**** Can I just execute these lines without the rest of the script and generate a .pkl file that will work? 
**** did not load the file properly ^^ 
**** ok so where am I now... I have taken out the VIP cell params stuff from above ^^ 
**** in A1/cells I copied VIP_edited_cellParams.pkl and renamed it VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl and added 'VIP_simple' to cellParamLabels list. Now it loads this pkl file and it seems to have all the relevant sections & mechanisms from the edited cell file. 
**** NEXT: (1) see how it differs if I use original VIP (VIP_orig_cellParams.pkl) 
***** change cellParamLabels list to have 'VIP_orig' rather than  'VIP_simple'
***** yup -- this one loads the larger model; change back 
**** NEXT: (2) how did I generate this pkl file?  
***** Used VIP_test_compare.py in A1/VIP_test and generated 2 pkl files, one with original (vipcr_cell_orig.hoc) and one edited (vipcr_cell.hoc)
***** Try again in A1/VIP_test directory to see if this generates the same pkl files 
***** yes -- so, script to generate is in A1/VIP_test/VIP_test_compare.py, which has lines to save the files (below)
# Adding this in order to save params as a pkl file 
##saveCellParams = True 
for i in range(0,len(allpops)):
    netParams.saveCellParamsRule(label=allpops[i],fileName=allpops[i]+'_cellParams.pkl')
##^^ This was fileName='cells/'+allpops[i]+'_cellParams.pkl') 
    **
**** CONCLUSION: the VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl file in A1/cells is generated using VIP_test_compare.py in A1/VIP_test
**** and VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl is the same as VIP_edited_cellParams.pkl in VIP_test 
**** ^^ used 'diff' command to compare 
*** CONCLUSION: Use VIP_simple_cellParams.pkl located in A1/cells to load VIP_simple cell (the edited of the original vip cell -- from https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=246546&file=/Turi_et_al_2018/cells/vipcr_cell.hoc#tabs-2)

** non-VIP (NGF) cells:
*** Workflow:
**** *Just make one population*
**** Start with VIP cells as a template 
**** Optimize cell type 
**** In terms of density -- should I get rid of them in layers that are not L1? 
*** What was the justification for using VIP cell as a template? Look in NB and on slack. --> *because VIP and NGF cells are both subsets of 5HT marked cells* 
*** NOTE: moved optimization figures from desktop (of laptop) to ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures
*** NOTES on NGF cells from the literature:
**** 'Electrophysiological Differences Between Neurogliaform Cells From Monkey and Rat Prefrontal Cortex'
***** rat NGF -- late-spiking cells (not so for monkey NGF)
***** monkey NGF -- higher input resistance, lower spike threshold, higher firing frequency, more spike adaptation 
*** Potential extant models:
**** https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=187604&file=/modeldbca1/cells/class_ngfcell.hoc#tabs-2
**** BBP S1 has a NGF cell -- messaged sid for pointer in the right direction 
*** Test-load potential model found on modeldb (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=187604&file=/modeldbca1/cells/class_ngfcell.hoc#tabs-2):
**** download hoc file: ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/cells/ngf_cell.hoc
**** download corresponding mod files 
**** make copies and test first in ~/Desktop/test_ngf 
***** mkdir ~/Desktop/test_ngf
***** put in all mod files and .hoc file (same dir -- no subdirs)
***** compile w/ nrnivmodl in above directory 
**** Changes I am making to test_ngf_simple.hoc file (in ~/Desktop/test_ngf):
***** deleting "// external variables" in beginning of file bc I suspect these are coming from external files that I am not loading 
***** commented out synapse stuff in proc init:
// synapses
	//pre_list = new List() // define a list for the presynaptic connections
	//define_synapses($3)	// local fcn: define all possible synaptic connections received by this cell
***** deleting gid and randi in proc_init because seems like this has to do with parallel processing:
(proc init() {
	//gid = $1
	//randi = $2)

****** "HEAD" points to the branch that you are working on
******* e.g. [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/head.png]]
****** To switch to the branch you created: =git checkout name_of_branch=
******* "HEAD" switches to testing branch
******* [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/switch.png]]
****** If you commit, this moves "HEAD" along the the branch:
******* e.g. [[~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1/figures/git_help/head_commit.png]]
****** To switch back to "master" branch: =git checkout master=
****** To merge: =git merge name_of_branch]=
****** To delete branch: =git branch -d name_of_branch=

** Version control
*** github

*** laptop
*** neurosim
*** comet 
** Importing NGF cell into netParams.py (commented out for now) 
** Edited name of NGF cell hoc file to ngf_cell.hoc (in cells subdir) 
** Edited test_ngf.py in A1 in order to import correct .hoc file (updated name) 
** Cut out extraneous parts of ngf_cell.hoc (now reflects what is in test dir on laptop) 
** Still need to lower the threshold -- work on SOMA FIRST 
** SOMA EDITS:
*** right now soma has Nav channel (ch_Navngf), Kdr_fast channel (ch_Kdrfastngf), and leak channel (ch_leak)
*** In the original file, all sections (thus, including soma), also had:
**** iconc_Ca
**** ch_KvAngf
**** ch_CavN
**** ch_CavL
**** ch_KCas
**** ch_KvCaB
**** ek = -90, eca = 130, e_ch_leak = -60
**** iconc_CaZ=2 (CaZ? iconc_Ca=2?) 
*** Adding proximal A-type potassium (ch_KvAngf) -- *fewer spikes*, went from 4 to 2 at 1.9nA current input (way too high still) 
*** Adding HAV-N channel (T-type calcium, ch_CavN) -- 2 spikes, but *closer together* (when added by itself, still 4 spikes) 
*** Adding L-type calcium channel (ch_CavL)  -- hard to say what effect this had
*** Adding small potassium channel, calcium gated (ch_KCaS) 
*** Before this line ^^ added iconc_Ca -- since small potassium channel is calcium gated, now having the calcium iconc_Ca mech in there made a difference
*** Adding big potassium channel (v- and ca-gated, ch_KvCaB) -- didn't seem to make too much difference 
*** did all this in test_ngf.hoc --> doing it in A1 copy now 
** *VERSION CONTROL CHECKPOINT*

** Noticing that the dendritic components have a lot more relevance than I thought they would -- taking away soma Na/K channels didn't actually eliminate action potentials - why is this? 
** *PROBLEM*: first spike will not go away
** *HYPOTHESES* & *POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS*:
*** (1) fast sodium channel is too fast to activate compared to the a-type potassium -- not supressed until after the first spike
**** Make sodium channel activation time constant slower
**** Make potassium channel activation time constant faster
**** Add a faster activating potassium channel into the mix? 
*** (3) May need a D-type potassium channel, as mentioned by sam? 
*** (4) Try a slower sodium channel 
*** (5) Try a faster potassium channel 
** TRIED SOLUTIONS:
*** *TRIED* (2) channel in soma alone is not good enough 
**** place in dendrites to see if there is an effect -- start with 1 dendrite and work your way up 
**** did rad1 
**** did rad1 and rad2 
**** Definitely increasing the firing threshold overall, but there is still an initial depolarization, so adding it to other dendrites isn't the problem

* <2019-07-30 Tue -- NGF cell modifications + connectivity data>
** NGF cells:
*** Add Ih to NGF cells
**** Using Migliore 2010 (h_migliore.mod)
**** Already present in A1/mod, but added it to cells/NGF_optimization
**** Recompile with nrnivmodl (rm -r x86_64 --> nrnivmodl) 
**** Add channel mechanism to ngf_cell.hoc
***** suffix: hd (found in mod file)
***** added to ngf_cell.hoc, in proc init(): insert hd, gbar_hd = 0.0001 
**** Test addition of channel mechanism:
***** created test_ngf.py on local machine just to see if it loads
***** python -i test_ngf.py --> WORKS
***** add test_ngf.py to git repo to test compile success on comet & neurosim
**** Add both files (ngf_cell.hoc & h_migliore.mod) to git repo
**** Re-compile in remote directories on COMET and NEUROSIM 
***** NEUROSIM: nrnivmodl in /u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization (no need to re-compile in main A1 directory because this mod file is already present) 
***** COMET: nrnivmodl in /home/eyg42/A1/cells/NGF_optimization 
***** Test re-compile by running test_ngf.py in .../cells/NGF_optimization subdir on COMET and NEUROSIM
****** DO NOT FORGET TO DO conda activate py36 in NEUROSIM or else will get outdated version of python 
****** Works on comet & neurosim (test_ngf.py) 
**** *NOTE*: Modify gmax only during optimization
*** Take care of netpyne clone problem for NGF now on COMET and NEUROSIM
***** cd ~/A1/cells/NGF_optimization
***** git clone -b development https://github.com/neurosim-lab/netpyne.git
***** cd netpyne; git checkout development ('Already on 'development'')
***** cd .. (make sure in ~/A1/cells/NGF_optimization)
***** mv netpyne netpyne_temp
***** cd netpyne_temp
***** mv netpyne ../netpyne
***** TEST: python, import netpyne, netpyne.__file__ should return: optimization_directory/netpyne/__init__.py --> WORKED on both COMET and NEUROSIM
*** Extract sag data from Fig 3B of paper mentioned yesterday (see nb entry)
*** Separate passive and active optimization
**** Start with passive: do grid search using netpyne
**** Create new fitness functions for active optimization
** Connectivity data:
*** Started new tab in gdrive spreadsheet entitled "FINAL DATA"
* <2019-08-01 Thu -- netParams changes>
** Separating L2/3 into L2 and L3 
*** netParams.py changes:
**** LAYER BOUNDARIES:
***** Cell parameters section change:
****** BEFORE: layer = {....'2': [0.05, 0.475]....{
****** NOW: layer = {...'2': [0.05, 0.08], '3': [0.08, 0.475]...} 
****** SOURCE: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00081/full
****** In the above source, L2 is approx 15% of total L2/3 depth, based on proportions found in figures. Thus, made L2 approx 15% of total L2/3 depth as well. 
***** Population parameters change:
****** Added ### LAYER 3 section w/ appropriate pops
****** Changed their names from IT2 --> IT3, etc. (changed name only)
**** DENSITIES:
***** '## load densities' loads a cellDensity.pkl file which needs to be modified first. 
***** Then, pop densities in  ### Layer 2 and ### Layer 3 (in # Population parameters) needs to be modified  
**** CELL TYPES:
***** in cellParamLabels, need to add in IT3 cell pops by name
***** need to also MAKE these pkl files or something?? 
**** netParams.version = 2
*** cfg.py changes:
**** in #Recording section, added the following to allpops: 'IT3', 'SOM3', 'PV3', 'VIP3'
**** added in Layer 3 pops to cfg.addNetStim in #NetStim inputs section 
** Added in Layer 1 netstims to cfg.py and L1 pops to 'allpops' also in cfg.py 
** Adding in L4 Spiny Stellate cells:
*** Changing IT4 into ITP4 (pyramidal) and ITS4 (stellate)
*** netParams.py changes:
**** In '#Population parameters' section, modified ## LAYER 4 so now netParams.popParams['IT4'] --> netParams.popParams['ITP4'] and netParams.popParams['ITS4']
**** DENSITY FOR THESE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED <-- similarly for L2 and L3 
*** cfg.py changes:
**** 'allpops' in #Recording section now includes 'ITP4' and 'ITS4' instead of 'IT4'
**** netstims --> changed to netstims to IT4 now go to ITP4 and ITS4 
*** netParams.version = 3

**** All mod files are in this directory, along with .hoc file (with Ih mechanism), and a test_ngf.py script to ensure it can get properly loaded in (checked -- works)
**** Created *NGF_evol_passive.py*

***** RMP = -67 #+/- 5mV 
**** Change paths:
***** if machine_ID == 'COMET': data_path_stem = '/oasis/scratch/comet/eyg42/temp_project/A1/NGF_passive/NGF_batch_data_gen_' --> NEEDS TO BE CREATED *[DONE]*

***** if machine_ID == 'zn': data_path_stem = '/u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive/NGF_batch_data_gen_' --> *DONE* NEEDS A GIT REPO UPDATE ON NEUROSIM TO MEAN ANYTHING
**** Changed how script determines which data files are completed:
***** compare data_files_DONE to data_files_NEEDED using sort and == 
**** Changed fitness functions:
***** RMP
****** CODE:

RMP_fitness = abs(RMP_sim-RMP)^2 # RMP defined in main code
****** squared the difference btwn target and result as well (see above) 
***** SUBTHRESHOLD RESPONSES fitness changed as well 
**** added fitnesses to fitnessCandidates 
*** NGF_batch_passive.py changes:

**** Change paths: 
***** in b.runCfg (in runType == hpc_slurm), added NGF_passive to *folder* path --> 'folder': '/home/eyg42/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive' 
***** in b.saveFolder for hpc_slurm runType --> '/oasis/scratch/comet/eyg42/temp_project/A1/NGF_passive/' (formerly last part of path was just 'NGF') 
*** Compiled mod files in NGF_passive on comet & neurosim & local  
** TO DO: Change the params being modified by NGF_evol_passive.py!! 
* <2019-08-07 Wed -- NGF passive>
** Try writing the fitness functions as actual functions to be called later 
** What params should be modified? 
*** Channels present:
**** ch_Navngf.mod: "sodium channel (voltage dependent, higher threshold)"
**** ch_Kdrfastngf.mod: "Fast delayed rectifier potassium channel (voltage dependent, for neurogliaform family)"
**** ch_leak.mod: leak conductance (voltage independent) 
**** h_migliore.mod: I-h channel from Magee 1998 for distal dendrites
**** ch_KvAngf.mod: Proximal A-type potassium 
**** ch_CavN: T-type calcium
**** ch_CavL: L-type calcium 
**** iconc_Ca.mod: intracellular calcium accumulation
**** ch_KCaS: small K+ channel; calcium gated
**** ch_KvCaB: Big K+ channel; voltage & ca2+ gated
*** samn: for passive parameters usually fit the *leak channel density/reversal*, and *capacitance*
*** ^^ Per advice above, should modify: gmax_ch_Navngf, ena, and cm
** NGF_evol_passive.py changes:
*** Changed re-write lines to pertain to the correct params and the correct lines in netParams.py
*** Changed num_inputs to 3 
** NGF_netParams.py changes:
*** Added 3 lines at the end for gmax, ena, and cm 
*** Commented out soma vinit line for now (set to RMP? meh) 

** Committed changes -- try running:
*** local
**** ERROR: in *NGF_evol_passive.py* no module named NGF_batch --> RESOLVED; changed to NGF_batch_passive (along with call from NGF_batch_passive to batch_full() function) [actually discovered on zn]
**** ERROR: in *NGF_batch_passive.py*, syntax error in params['amp'] --> RESOLVED (period instead of comma) 
**** ERROR: in *NGF_evol_passive.py* out of range --> Did not fill in min or max params in main code --> RESOLVED
**** ERROR --> did not throw an error, but *NGF_evol_passive.py* did not work properly for finding finished data files. Fixed this part of the code and tested some parts locally. Try local run again to see if resolved. --> RESOLVED after using .issubset -- was comparing one set of data files which contained .json results files from all candidates in the generation, and then a set of data files with only 1 candidate's results. 
**** ERROR --> index out of range in line 131 in *NGF_evol_passive.py* --> am currently indexing by the larger set mentioned in the last point; try indexing by the smaller one to see if this resolves. 
**** ERROR --> another index out of range in *NGF_evol_passive.py* , but this might be caused by syntax problem in subthreshold_deltas definition in main code --> it was; RESOLVED
**** WORKS -- funkiness occurred with generation because I set the pop sizes and whatnot so low for testing; don't worry about this now. 
**** CHANGED RUN PARAMS (increased pop sizes and whatnot) -- now test on zn 
*** zn
**** pulled all changes listed above 
**** ssh into zn from no
**** cd /u/ericag/A1
**** conda activate py36
**** screen -L python NGF_evol_passive.py --> RUNNING NOW; DETACH (crtl+a d) 
**** To return: screen -r 
**** ERROR --> user error; input 'LOCAL' instead of 'zn' when entering machine_ID -- try again. BUT, [DONE] fix the thing below first re: mean_responses calculated only after delay 
**** Trying again 
*** comet 
** TO DO: 
*** Change comet run so uses shared partition 
*** [DONE] mean_responses[i] = steady_state_response

** Changed cfg.duration from 1.5*1e3 to 1.1*1e3 (1100 ms accounts for stim delay and stim input) 
* <2019-08-09 Fri -- NGF passive>
** Not sure why, but optimization stalled on 'zn' after only 7 runs 
** Adding a 'partition' option to batch run:
*** Changing hpc_slurm b.runCfg to add a 'partition' option for 'shared' -- let's see if this works. --> did NOT work 
*** Trying 'custom': '#SBATCH -p=partition' (adding to b.runCfg) [per salva's suggestion]
*** sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Job violates accounting/QOS policy (job submit limit, user's size and/or time limits)
*** ^^ shared partition can only use 1 node at a time, I believe (true), and example on comet user guide (https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html) shows only using 8 cores per node. Changing this in batch script (from 24 'coresPerNode' to 8) 
*** With the above changes, seems to be working on *comet* 
*** Changing 'coresPerNode' from 8 to 1 in b.runCfg for runType == 'hpc_slurm' because should only require one core. 
* <2019-08-11 Sun -- NGF passive on google cloud>
** Salvador ran ~1000 generations successfully on google cloud
** Suggestions for improvement:
*** Ran out of space -- save cfg and netParams to output, but do not plot trace
**** Commented out in *NGF_cfg.py*: cfg.analysis['plotTraces'] = {'include': [0], 'saveFig': True} 
*** Turn on logging for each generation 
**** https://aarongarrett.github.io/inspyred/troubleshooting.html#use-and-consult-the-logs
**** added 'import logging' to import section of *NGF_evol_passive.py* 
* <2019-08-15 Thu -- active setup & passive modifications>
** Sleep interval changes:
*** Sleep interval decreased from 1 to 0.1 (per salva's advice) in *NGF_evol_passive.py*
*** But... salva's advice was for runCfg to be changed, so I changed it in *NGF_cfg.py* as well 
*** Need to update netpyne to see 
** Netpyne update (development branch pulled):
*** http://www.netpyne.org/install.html
*** =git clone https://github.com/Neurosim-lab/netpyne.git=
*** =cd netpyne=
*** =git checkout development=

** Test the above on comet to see if this lowers time/generation

** running on zn because comet is arbitrarily crashing: 
*** ERROR:
*** Solutions:
**** contact help desk
**** have salva show me how to deploy gcloud cluster 
** Changes to NGF_evol_passive.py for evol run:
*** added fn_stem and fn_EMO to 'if machine_ID ==' block for ease of use in the custom observer functions. 
*** widened the range of gmax param
** Changes to NGF_evol_passive.py & NGF_batch_passive.py for data dir on zn:
*** changed runType=='mpi_bulletin' statements about data dirs to include NGF_passive/data/ + batchLabel, etc. (new thing is the 'data' subdir of NGF_passive -- created on neurosim server already) 
*** Changed corresponding lines in NGF_evol_passive.py 
** TRANSFERRED REPO TO suny-downstate-medical-center/neurosim (organization/team) for widened access. On each system (comet, no, and local, changed git remote):
*** (1) git remote -v (to check)
*** (2) git remote set-url origin https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/A1.git 
*** (3) git remote -v (to check again)  

** *Why* are all the fitness values the same on the comet run?? Run this on zn for a day and check back in. (the 'g' in ch_leak?) 
** Compiled mod files on 'no' in /u/ericag/A1/cells/NGF_optimization/NGF_passive, using =nrnivmodl=
** Recall, on 'zn', 2 things necessary to do to the environment:
*** conda activate py36

*** automate data directory clearance before each run 
* <2019-08-27 Tue -- NGF cell hand-tuning + connectivity data>

** Hand-tune NGF cell:
*** (on laptop) mkdir ~/Desktop/NGF_cell
*** Populate this directory with the correct files 
*** nrnivmodl to compile; python -i test_ngf.py to test: WORKING
*** Modify 
*** GOALS:
**** RMP = -67mV 
***** Took out ch_leak and added 'insert pas' instead
***** Changed e_pas in ngf_cell.hoc in order to get good RMP 
**** Get down to -105mV with -0.12 amp input
***** With params below, -66.99 --> -67.08 with -0.12 nA input
cm = 1

// LEAK CHANNEL
e_pas = -67.10
g_pas = 0.001 //0.001 is default

// Ih for SAG 
gbar_hd = 0.0001
***** Change cm:
****** Increase --> "smoother" changes in voltage (makes sense; holds onto charge better?) 
***** Change g_pas:
****** Increase --> 
****** Decrease --> 
* <2019-08-28 Wed -- NGF>
** GIT VERSION CONTROL NUMBERS:
*** a599dd8
*** be123e8
** deleted 'email' line for runType hpc_slurm in NGF_batch_passive.py
** added 'nodes': 1 and 'coresPerNode': 24 to runType mpi_bulletin in NGF_batch_passive.py 
** Increased sleepinterval to 0.3 in evol and batch_passive scripts. 
** THINGS TO DEAL WITH:
*** "NONE" values being decoded 
*** Sleep Interval --> increased from 0.1 to 0.5 in evol and batch
*** email on comet --> deleted from b.runCfg in batch
*** num_elites --> go from 1 to 0
*** final pop print lines? 
*** pas mechanism: ch_leak or pas? 
*** add another compartment? (dend)? 
*** logging? 
*** ec.observers.stats_observer recoverable in multi-objective? 
*** no plotting from netpyne -- how to achieve this?  
*** automate data directory move before each run

**** L6 Pyramidal (M/L) [1/2, not counting inverted]
**** L6 Star Pyramidal (Apical & Basal??) 
** Steps:
*** Figure out how to load .pkl files in A1/cells
**** (1) python; import pickle; with open('FILENAME.pkl','rb') as fileObj: data = pickle.load(fileObj, encoding='bytes')
***** The encoding='bytes' resolves the following error: *UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xfa in position 2: ordinal not in range(128)* 
**** (2) netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='CT6_reduced',fileName='CT6_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
*** Start with modification of L2 Excitatory cells
**** Excitatory Pop in the model: IT2
**** IT2 needs apical dendrites in L2 and in L1 
**** L1 normalized layer boundaries: [0.00, 0.05] --> 0-100
**** L2 normalized layer boundaries: [0.05, 0.08] --> 100-160
**** File: A1/cells/IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl
***** LOAD file:
****** with python; import pickle; from netpyne import specs; netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT2_reduced',fileName='IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
***** 3 apical dendrites & 1 basal dendrite
***** Current geometry of Adend1:
****** netParams.cellParams['IT2_reduced']['secs']['Adend1']['geom']
****** diam = 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 48.4123467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 145.1623467666, 0, 1.5831889597]]}
***** Current geometry of Adend2:
****** diam: 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 145.1623467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 241.9123467666, 0, 1.5831889597]]
***** Current geometry of Adend3: 
****** diam: 1.5831889597
****** L: 96.75
****** pt3d: [[0, 241.9123467666, 0, 1.5831889597], [0, 338.66234676659997, 0, 1.5831889597]]
**** I need IT2 to go from within L2 (100-160, 0.05 - 0.08), up to within L1 (0-100, 0 - 0.05). Max length is therefore 160 (160 --> 0), and min length is ~0 (100-100). If cell body located approximately in the middle of L2 (~130, 0.065) and dendrite extends to approximately middle of L1 (~50, 0.025), then dendrite length would be ~80 (0.065 --> 0.025). 
**** Shorten pt3d and L for apical dendrites
*** Questions:
**** RESOLVED:
***** What is the total depth of the model? --> *2000*
***** How to correlate length with normalized layer depth? 
****** I: 0-100 
****** II: 100-160
****** III: 160-950 
****** IV: 950-1250
****** VA: 1250-1334
****** VB: 1334-1550
****** VI: 1550-2000
***** What do the values in pt3d correspond to? 
****** x, y, z, diam
****** https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/py_doc/modelspec/programmatic/topology/geometry.html
***** How to modify the lengths when there is a pt3d? 
***** Do I modify all apical dendrites or just one? 
**** This wiring diagram does not explicitly show pyramidal cell bodies in L4, only sort of spiny stellate.  
**** What do I do about L5A / L5B? 
**** For cells that appear to have synapses along the dendrite in multiple superior layers, do I need to just adjust one dendrite to be long enough to reach through all of the layers or do I need to make different ones for each layer that it goes through? Probably just one and have them synapse...? 
* <2019-09-12 Thu -- dendrite adjustments>
** All of these changes are happening on laptop in ~/Desktop/cells
** Using script cell_save.py with function change_geom(cellName,L) which will change pt3d and L (in geom)
** Pops that need to extend to L1 [L5 pop UNFINISHED]:
*** IT2
**** IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl --> IT2_reduced_new.pkl
**** midpoint to midpoint strategy as noted by salva: 50 is midpoint of L1, 130 is midpoint of L2, so L = 80
**** cd ~/Desktop/cells/ ; python ; import cell_save ; cell_save.change_geom('IT2_reduced, 80)
*** IT3
**** Does not have a separate pkl file right now
**** Is there anything in the pkl file for IT2_reduced_cellParams.pkl that would preclude me from copying and renaming it IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl? *DID THIS IN ~/Desktop/cells*
**** Midpoint of L3 is 555 (160-950) and midpoint of L1 is 50 --> L = 505
**** cd ~/Desktop/cells; python; import cell_save; cell_save.geom('IT3_reduced',505)
**** IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl --> IT3_reduced_new.pkl
*** L5 pyramidal L/XL --> IT5A, IT5B, PT5B?? which one, which layer? 
** Pops that need to extend to L2 
*** 

** IN light of IT3 modifications (see previous point), I should change *netParams.py* as well, yes?

*** L4 spiny stellate needs to go from L4 --> L3 
*** L4 [1100; 950-1250] --> L3 [555; 160-950]
*** Length = 545 (1100-555) 
*** In ITS4.py, dend.L = self.rho * self.soma.L
**** self.rho = 165
**** self.soma.L = 10
**** To change length, (1) change rho (2) change soma.L (3) just set dend.L = 545
*** Tried to change dend.L in ITS4.py in ~/Desktop/cells, but having trouble with ca_ion. Loads fine in ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1 (python -i netParams.py), so I think it's something to do with the mod files. Changing it in the file here, not in temp dir on local desktop. --> works

** Make a git branch for this
*** git checkout -b cells
*** OR git branch cells; git checkout cells
** Cell editing continued:
*** Go to cells branch (=git checkout cells=) 
*** mkdir dend_edits; cd dend_edits
** Populating git branch:
*** Go to cells branch (=git checkout cells=) 
*** mkdir dend_edits; cd dend_edits
*** copied in all mod files; nrnivmodl (to compile) 
*** NOTE: see 9/17 entry for algorithm on changing dendrite lengths
*** Copied in (from ~/Desktop/cells --> where I was doing all the edits) the following cell files:
**** IT2_reduced
**** IT3_reduced
**** ITS4.py (spiny stellate)
**** IT4_reduced
**** IT5A_reduced
**** IT5B_reduced
**** PT5B_reduced 
**** IT6_reduced (goes to L5) 
**** CT6_reduced 
**** ITC6_reduced (goes to L1) 
*** Also put in netParams_OLD.py, netParams_NEW.py, overlay_ACTIVE.py, and overlay_PASSIVE.py for cell tuning (see below)
*** Also put in cell_batch.py, cfg.py, and init.py so that scripts listed above can have access to batch (needed for comparison)
*** Put in test_cell.py in order to do pre-comparison testing
*** git add and commit like usual (making sure on correct branch)
*** git push origin cells --> to push changes 
** Cell tuning algorithm:
*** (0) Change basics of 3 sets of scripts:
**** netParams_OLD.py and netParams_NEW.py (3 things for both, 1 extra in NEW):
***** (i) 'cellType' in netParams.popParams
***** (ii) label and (iii) fileName in cellRule (netParams.loadCellParamsRule)
***** *FOR NEW ONLY* (iv) netParams.cellParams[CELLNAME e.g. 'IT3_reduced'
**** overlay_PASSIVE.py and overlay_ACTIVE.py:
***** Make sure each overlay graph has the correct title (plt.title, at the end in plotting section) 
**** test_cell.py: change cellType, label, and fileName, along with netParams.cellParams[]
*** (1) Look at existing mechanisms:
**** cd .../A1/cells/dend_edits
**** In terminal: python
**** from netpyne import specs
**** netParams = specs.NetParams()
**** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_cellParams.pkl')
**** *EXPLORE PARAMS*: netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['mechs']
*** (2) Make a list of which mechanisms should be modified for passive and which for active
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g']
*** (3) Change netParams_NEW.py according to above findings:
**** Add in lines that will allow you to change param values: 
**** e.g. netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['pas']['g'] = placeholder_value
**** e.g. v_init sometimes too: 
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['globals']['v_init'] = -80 #-85.3
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['vinit'] = -80 #-85.3
*** (4) *PASSIVE FIT* 
**** Change things above
**** Delete (on FIRST iteration), data_old (or rename) --> will contain data from last cell fitted 
**** Run python -i overlay_PASSIVE.py 
**** save fig as cellName_ORIG_PASSIVE_FIT.png 
**** Adjust params iteratively in netParams_NEW.py until reasonable passive fit is achieved
****** May also test values in test_cell.py just to see what traces look like 
****** have to sometimes adjust v_init in test_cell.py for trace visualization 
*** (5) *ACTIVE FIT* 
**** use test_cell.py to find rheobase 
**** change current_steps in overlay_ACTIVE.py so first value is near rheobase
**** change params['amp'] in batch (if FitType == 'active':\ params['amp'] = [])
**** *on first iteration* : Delete data_old (there will be data from last cell in there bc batch doesn't overwrite data_old) 
**** run python -i overlay_ACTIVE.py 
**** look at original param values:
***** python; from netpyne import specs
***** netParams = specs.NetParams()
***** netParams.loadCellParamsRule(label='IT3_reduced', fileName='IT3_reduced_new_cellParams.pkl')
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs'].keys()
***** netParams.cellParams['IT3_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['nax']
**** change values (up or down) in netParams_NEW.py (netParams.cellParams[]...)
**** save figures that you want to save
*** (6) Make traces
**** use test_cell.py with the new params
**** OR look in data_new / data_old directories 
** Save new cells in .pkl format: save_cell.py (in dend_edits) 
** Test ^^ new .pkl file in test_cell 
*** (may need to comment out del netParams.cellParams[...conds] if that's in there) 
** Transfer to cells directory and rename

I've tried   a bunch of stuff to figure it out but so far no headway -- can't find much on this error from previous slack chats or in github, at least not enough to crack the problem
samn 1:26 PM
iclamp is for the tuning?
ericaygriffith 1:26 PM
I saw a long time ago that you two had a similar issue and there was some kind of Mac-related conversation around this, but it wasn't the same exact error and I had trouble figuring out if it applied here
yeah, need to do IClamp for tuning
samn 1:27 PM
what's diff between the pkl files?
ericaygriffith 1:28 PM
I've tried looking at the line-by-line differences and it hasn't shed much light on why one would work and one wouldn't -- I had an IT4 file I was using that didn't work; I copied in an old IT4 from M1 and that worked -- when I did line-by-line comparison only difference was the ynorm values
but couldn't figure out why that would make such a big difference, but it does seem to
but again not sure if that's the root of the problem? maybe when changing ynorm an encoding issue happened? but can't tell why or how to fix it, or when it happens vs. when it doesn't?
just wondering if either of you had seen before -- I am going to keep plugging away but wanted to share the issue
I know there was some py2 vs py3 stuff with the pkl files, but again -- this error isn't happening for all of them, so I don't know if that's relevant or not
samn 1:30 PM
sections specified in same way for the two cell types?
ericaygriffith 1:30 PM
yeah they seem to be
same sections, secLists
etc.
samn 1:30 PM
error seemed to indicate that the section where you wanted to put the clamp doesn't exist, so defaults to soma
ericaygriffith 1:30 PM
right
but both of them, when I load w/ loadCellParamsRule have the same sections
samn 1:31 PM
so the difference is a pkl file with parameters or also py file differs?
ericaygriffith 1:32 PM
I don't have the .py file for a lot of these bc I started with the M1 .pkl files and have been working with those -- I see in M1detailed there is an ITcell.py but other than that, don't have any .py
we talked about this awhile ago and concluded it was okay to work with the .pkl files, iirc
are you able to get an IClamp stim working with both of those files above? if so, then maybe something on my end?
samn 1:33 PM
so pkl specifies geometry as well as params...
ericaygriffith 1:33 PM
y
samn 1:33 PM
i haven't used this feature...if i clone your repo do you have a run sequence i can try?
ericaygriffith 1:34 PM
I have a test_cell.py I'll attach here (I haven't added it to the repo bc just for testing this problem) -- let me attach here
samn 1:34 PM
ok
this is up to date? https://github.com/suny-downstate-medical-center/A1
ericaygriffith 1:35 PM
yeah should be, I'm working on cells branch

in A1/cells/dend_edits --> keeping these changes contained in that subdir for now
will clean that up when merging
sry if not convention to do the way I'm doing; i'm just doing what makes sense as I go along
samn 1:36 PM
np
salvadord 1:40 PM
I'll have a look in a sec
samn 1:40 PM
thx
salvadord 1:42 PM
Should be ok to work with pkl... maybe some minor err somewhere so cells not instantiated properly
ericaygriffith 1:42 PM
y seems like it -- some of the .pkl files work just fine, some don't. very hard to tell why, but guessing it's some detail that I haven't tracked down eyt
yet*
samn 1:42 PM
cloned repo and set to cells branch
can you save that test_cells.py file to neurosim?
ericaygriffith 1:43 PM
sure thing one sec
samn 1:44 PM
oh, i got it
nevermind
ericaygriffith 1:45 PM
great -- let me know if there are issues. the ones that have A1 in the .pkl name have the parameters tuned.
samn 1:46 PM
so you run with python3 -i test_cell.py ?
ericaygriffith 1:46 PM
so e.g. for me, IT2_A1_cellParams.pkl works, but IT5A_reduced_cellParams.pkl does not work
y locally that is what I do to test
samn 1:46 PM
and compile with mkmod or nrnivmodl?
ericaygriffith 1:46 PM
I just change the name in the loadCellParams line
nrnivmodl at the moment (was wondering if that was the problem but tested and didn't make a diff on my machine yesterday)
samn 1:47 PM
k
IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl - where is that?
ericaygriffith 1:51 PM
should be in A1/cells
samn 1:52 PM
so you do python3 -i cell_test.py A1/cells/IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl ?
what's command you use?
got error that couldn't find the file when i just ran python3 -i test.py
ericaygriffith 1:54 PM
something dumber, I change the line in test_cell.py (the netParams.loadCellParams line) to reflect the right .pkl file, then run "python -i test_cell.py" -- I know I should change so I can just enter the filename sry
I attached the test_cell.py file above
samn 1:56 PM
ok, i was running from A1 dir, have to specify full path to the pkl
i get same error
/u/samn/A1/test.py
ericaygriffith 1:56 PM
okay so not just me -- are you able to use cells/IT2_A1_cellParams.pkl without getting that error?
samn 1:56 PM
lms
yeah, that one works
ericaygriffith 1:59 PM
ok, so same issue... I went back to the M1 repo and grabbed that repo's IT5B_reduced_cellParams.pkl and it didn't work either, so I don't think it was something I did with A1 changes? I'm not sure though. I'm going to keep investigating.
samn 2:03 PM
ok, i'll take a look at the pkl files too
pickle.load gives ascii errors
suppose you use encoding='ASCII'
ericaygriffith 2:08 PM
so encoding I'm not sure -- I remember there was some py2 vs py3 encoding stuff that happened; I can look back in my nb to see if relevant
samn 2:08 PM
but that gives UnicodeDecodeError
ericaygriffith 2:08 PM
yes I remember that error
samn 2:09 PM
how'd you load the pkl files?
ericaygriffith 2:09 PM
I think i had to specify encoding... latin1 I think?
let me look to make sure
samn 2:09 PM
ok that worked
so the idea is to have it human-readable?
ericaygriffith 2:09 PM
also used 'bytes' at one point it seems
i personally don't care if human-readable or not, I was just trying to get them to load bc I wasn't familiar with their contents before, so was just checking them out
I'll defer to you guys with respect to encoding,e tc.
samn 2:10 PM
will try resaving and see if it works
ericaygriffith 2:11 PM
good idea -- I have been using .saveCellParamsRule in netpyne to re-save after changes; looking for that function now on github to see if that has something to do with it potentially
samn 2:11 PM
didn't help
ericaygriffith 2:14 PM
:/ hm, okay -- what did you do to re-save? out of curiosity
samn 2:14 PM
ok, so they both have same sections...
pickle.dump(d5,open('cells/IT5B_new.pkl','wb'))
and geom
how'd you compare the dictionaries?
salvadord 2:17 PM
if run just python netParams.py should see if any specific errors loading or saving the pkl
ericaygriffith 2:18 PM
a few ways... saved them and compared with ==, turned some parts into lists and looked at line-by-line differences, things like that. I was trying a couple approaches to try to get at everything i could think of
yeah -- so, no errors loading or saving, I can load them okay
it's when I try to apply an IClamp that it says that there is no sec specified so default to soma, but then it does not default to soma and I get no trace
samn 2:18 PM
and can netpyne access the sections without the iclamp?
ericaygriffith 2:18 PM
but I can see the sections when I load that .pkl with loadCellParamsRule
what do you mean by access specifically
samn 2:19 PM
are they properly setup/represented
ericaygriffith 2:19 PM
like I can load the pkl files into netParams.cellParams['cellName'] and then see the ['secs'] and what not
I'll try anything else, sorry if I'm not understanding
salvadord 2:19 PM
not different to see the sections in netParams (high-level specs) vs in net.cells (instantiated)
samn 2:20 PM
so the sections exist
ericaygriffith 2:20 PM
oh hmm I haven't looked at that salva, let me see
samn 2:21 PM
btw, Nafcr is not part of the repo afaik - got error about vipcr_cell.hoc when run netParams.py
ericaygriffith 2:21 PM
oh really? I have it in my mods directory
samn 2:21 PM
so netParams and net.cells - those should exist even in the test file erica made?
ericaygriffith 2:21 PM
mod* sorry
samn 2:21 PM
i see netParams but no net object
sim.net ?
mod*?
ericaygriffith 2:22 PM
I meant that I have nafcr.mod in the mod subdir
samn 2:22 PM
ok, sim.net.cells
nafcr.mod - right, i see it there...
not sure how you're running net though, but that's separate issue
ericaygriffith 2:23 PM
oh I was just about to ask that lol
I assumed I had to run netParams.py so I did but then realized I wasn't sure from there; was in the midst of googling
salvadord 2:24 PM
looks like not properly instantiated — no secs

ericaygriffith 2:24 PM
open to instruction of course
how do I get to sim.net?
samn 2:24 PM
not properly instantiated, so problem found :slightly_smiling_face:
ok, i see it's empty too
you have sim object in your test file
so where'd that pkl file with the problem come from then?
or...is it correct but there's a problem reading it in netpyne
salvadord 2:25 PM
reason is that the ‘conds’ are loaded from pkl and not updated to match your test — i.e. only applied to ynorm: [0.667, 0.775]
Untitled 
In [7]: netParams.cellParams['IT5B_reduced']['conds']
Out[7]: {cellModel: 'HH_reduced', cellType: 'IT', ynorm: [0.667, 0.775]}


samn 2:27 PM
so ynorm is property of that cell class
and conds for stim target are on TestPop
salvadord 2:27 PM
can just add del netParams.cellParams['IT5B_reduced']['conds'] — now works
samn 2:28 PM
TestPop separate from IT5B_reduced
how does netpyne know IT5B_reduced == TestPop?
salvadord 2:28 PM
for each cellParams properties there are a set of rules (conds) to decide which cells these properties will be applied to
netParams.popParams['TestPop'] = {'cellType': 'IT', 'numCells': 1, 'cellModel': 'HH_reduced'}
ericaygriffith 2:29 PM
the cellModel and cellType link them together as far as I can tell
salvadord 2:29 PM
cells in testPop have the properties cellType and cellModel… exactly
samn 2:29 PM
HH_reduced
is HH_reduced mentioned in the pkl file?
ericaygriffith 2:29 PM
y, in pkl file it specifies cellModel is HH_reduced, so I put that in TestPop as well
pkl file specifies cellType and cellmodel
samn 2:30 PM
ic, so if there was > 1 HH_reduced type, it would apply to all of them
ericaygriffith 2:30 PM
but only if the cellType was the same as well
salvadord 2:30 PM
yeah
this method can be overkill for simple models… but allows for more flexibility when specifying properties of cells
ericaygriffith 2:31 PM
so salva, let me see if I get this -- I figured it was something to do with ynorm bc I was able to break my ITP4 cell by changing ynorm, but you're saying if I just get rid of ynorm in the .pkl files maybe I'll be able to fix this?
in 'conds'?
salvadord 2:32 PM
so this is to solve the specific cell_test.py script you mentioned above
ericaygriffith 2:32 PM
y, but at some point I need to have them in order to localize them in the layers right?
or maybe that can be done another way?
salvadord 2:33 PM
generally just need to remember when loading from pkl, the conds/rules are also loaded… so just check that the cellParams ‘conds’ match what you want to do — can still use ‘ynorm’ since needed in network
ericaygriffith 2:33 PM
okay I thought so....
I got to this point last night at least, which is encouraging that I was on the right track
but i still wasn't able to solve the problem; but now let me look again
I'm probably overthinking something
salvadord 2:34 PM
but in the single test cell script the cell had a y location outside 0.667-0.775, so the cell params didnt apply to it
ericaygriffith 2:34 PM
ohhhh, I see I see I see
so in pt3d you mean
pt3d conflict with ynorm?
wasn't sure how that worked bc of normalized vs. non-normalized
salvadord 2:34 PM
not pt3d… that separate… in cell[‘tags’][‘y’]
ericaygriffith 2:34 PM
oh tags
oh had no idea that was a thing
salvadord 2:35 PM
all cells have x,y,zy when instantiated
randomly placed in network

samn 2:35 PM
and ynorm and y were inconsistent even though in same pkl?
salvadord 2:36 PM
ynorm and y were consistent
the pkl just stored the high level specs, not the actual location once instantiated … that happens later
ericaygriffith 2:36 PM
so the high-level specs (ynorm and y) were in conflict w/ the actual instantiated location
samn 2:36 PM
and what set the actual instantiated location?
ericaygriffith 2:36 PM
?
y my next question as well
salvadord 2:37 PM
so the high-level specs doesn’t define the ynorm or y … just specified a condition saying “only cells that end being within 0.6-0.7 y loc should rececive these properties’
once network is instantiated (sim.net.createCells() ) … each cell gets assigned a random location within the network volume
network volume defined by netParams.sizeX, sizeY, sizeZ … and specific spatial constraints for populations can be specified in netParmas.popParams (eg. ynormRange: [0.3,0.4])
samn 2:39 PM
so the network volume didn't include those cell ynorm ranges?
or something in net was inconsistent so the cell wasn't created properly
salvadord 2:40 PM
yeah, but the single cell instantiate in the test_cell.py script happened to be outside that range
i.e. ‘ynorm’: 0.3984944342173416 not inside [0.6667, 0.775]
samn 2:40 PM
and netParams.py was used in that test file via specs.NetParams() ?
salvadord 2:41 PM
nope, had its own netParams
nothing inconsistent, workins as expected
ericaygriffith 2:41 PM
is there a reason it's so consistent? like, IT2 always works but IT5B doesn't -- if it's randomly placed, shouldn't it potentially work some of the time and some of the time no?
either way that is very helpful -- ty as always salva. let me digest this and drink some coffee and fix. ty!!
salvadord 2:43 PM
if you instantiate a single cell using same default randomization, will always be placed in same place — so it’s reproducible (so prob happens to match IT2 y range)
ericaygriffith 2:44 PM
ohh I see
makes sense -- ok great, I think I can piece together the solution from here! hopefully! will update
thank you!!
salvadord 2:44 PM
great!
samn 2:56 PM
thx!
** Conclusion for now I believe is just to add =del netParams.cellParams[cellName]['conds']= after the line where the .pkl file is loaded 
** This will at least enable you to fix the param tuning. Let them know that ynorm / actual instantiation of cell location is up for debate (can look at this later if have time).

***** netParams.popParams['CT5B'] =     {'cellType': 'CT',  'cellModel': 'HH_reduced',   'ynormRange': layer['5B'],   'density': 0.5*density[('A1','E')][5]}  # density is [5] because we are using same numbers for L5B and L6 for CT cells? 
***** did density as [5] because same as L6? see comment above?
*** Add CT5B_A1_cellParams.pkl to cells subdir 
**** Copied CT6_A1_cellParams.pkl and renamed to CT5B_A1_cellParams.pkl 
**** Tested in cells/dend_edits subdir to make sure it works 
**** no changes to geom -- is that okay? 
*** version control: 
**** git add, git commit, git push origin cells (from cells branch) 
**** 9390a28..4da8ffc  cells -> cells
** Add CT cells to L5A: 
*** netParams.version = 13
*** Added CT5A cells to netParams.py
**** Added to cellParamLabels = {...}
**** 'CT5A_A1': {'cellModel': 'HH_reduced', 'cellType': 'CT', 'ynorm': layer['5A']},
**** Added to netParams.popParams:
***** netParams.popParams['CT5A'] =     {'cellType': 'CT',  'cellModel': 'HH_reduced',   'ynormRange': layer['5A'],   'density': 0.5*density[('A1','E')][5]}  # density is [5] because we are using same numbers for L5A and L6 for CT cells? 
***** did density as [5] because same as L6? see comment above?
*** Add CT5A_A1_cellParams.pkl to cells subdir
**** (NOTE: untested)
**** copied CT6_A1_cellParams.pkl and renamed
**** did not change geom
** Fixed densities of E cells in L5A & L5B 
*** netParams.py version 14
*** in netParams.popParams section
*** Kept evenly distributed densities (i.e. netParams.popParams['CT5B'] = {... 'density': (1/3)*density[('A1','E')][4])}
** Added version info at the bottom of netParams.py (v14) 
** Added CT5A & CT5B to Epops in netParams.py (v14) 
** Compile new mod mechanisms for RE, TC, and HTC cells
*** When merged cells w/ salva branch (on cells branch -- described above), new mod files came with it
*** Re-compiled:
**** on cells branch, locally on laptop, cd ~/Desktop/NEUROSIM/A1
**** rm -r mod/x86_64
**** rm x86_64
**** ln -s mod/x86_64 x86_64
**** cd mod
**** nrnivmodl
**** cd ..
*** output after nrnivmodl:

**** mod files I'm not sure about: 
***** libnrnmech.la
***** mod_func.c and mod_func.lo, but no mod_func.mod? 
***** nafcr.mod --> looks compiled; did I do this now, or was it like this beforehand??
***** special --> pretty sure this is used in neuron stuff, created by the software; not going to touch

**** Tried copying mod directory to desktop to see if it works there; don't know why nrnivmodl stops running part of the way through the directory, but it doesn't seem to make it past a certain point (stops due to some kind of error maybe?). Either way, "nrnivmodl <file.mod>" only puts that mechanism into 'special'; this is not a cumulative process. Doing "nrnivmodl <file1.mod> <file2.mod>" will put both file1 and fil2 into special, rendering both of those mechanisms usable. Have to figure out which mod files are causing the issue. 

*** ISSUE 1 FIXED:
**** Added the file aux_fun.inc to mod and re-compiled. This file was mentioned in all the errors listed above. 
**** Found this file on modeldb, from a paper from Sam (2011): https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel.cshtml?model=139421&file=/hpcdemo/aux_fun.inc#tabs-2
* <2019-11-10 Sun -- Get updated model to run locally>
** GOAL: Get network running locally (on my laptop) 
** NEED: CT5A_A1_weightNorm.pkl and CT5B_A1_weightNorm.pkl: 
*** Copied CT6_A1_weightNorm.pkl & re-named it for CT5A & CT5B
*** Put these files into A1/cells
** VERSION CONTROL:
*** Add aux_fun.inc in A1/mod
*** Add CT5A_A1_weightNorm.pkl and CT5B_A1_weightNorm.pkl 
* <2019-11-11 Mon -- TC/HTC cells>
** TC and HTC cells showing subthreshold oscillations 
*** Check to see if this was present before AND after mod file change to htc.mod
*** TC cells:
**** A1/cells/sTC.py
**** on local machine (laptop): cd ~/Desktop; mkdir TC_test
**** In TC_test, added py files: sTC.py, sTC_new.py, and test_cell.py
***** sTC.py gets the orig htc.mod
***** sTC_new.py gets the htc_new.mod (suffix modified to htc_new, see below), and class renamed to sTC_new 
**** In TC_test, added mod files: htc.mod (ORIG FILE), htc_new.mod, cadad.mod, HH2.mod, IT.mod, kl.mod, tia.mod
***** Changed suffix in htc_new.mod to htc_new
**** Created sTC_new.py, and inserted htc_new into soma 
**** Compile mod files in TC_test with nrnivmodl (success)
** Difference between orig and new sTC cells:
*** Changes to htc.mod file:
**** ORIG line 87: USEION h READ eh WRITE ih VALENCE 1
**** NEW  line 87: :USEION h READ eh WRITE ih VALENCE 1
**** ORIG: NONSPECIFIC_CURRENT ih (NOT PRESENT IN NEW)
**** NEW: RANGE eh (NOT PRESENT IN ORIG) 

** Salva merge cells w/ some of his edits, need to clean up some unnecessary files causing lots of unimportant differences in branches:
*** git rm -r cells/dend_edits 
*** git commit -m 'deleting dend_edits folder'
*** git rm -r cells/NGF_archived_files_and_figures
*** got rid of .pyc files as well in __pycache__ dirs throughout the repo

***** This is identical to Condition 4


*** NOTE: with the new htc.mod file, if I don't set anything, it sets eh_htc to 0, it seems? 
*** SO ^^, what if I try to set the old one to 0... will that make it oscillate? or maybe it can't because it's a range var in the new one, but not in the orig mod file?? 
**** can't seem to set it in test_cell.py or in sTC.py -- probably bc not range var, I'm guessing

*** CURRENT TC SETUP in A1 repo: 
**** mod file being used is htc_new.mod, suffix htc
**** in sTC.py, self.soma.eh is commented out
** htc.mod file now being used in A1 is the 'original' htc.mod (without the RANGE eh 'quick fix' made by salva and sam before SfN) --> except now, the USEION h line has been deleted.

* <2019-11-22 Fri -- thal interneuron model passive fitting>
** Set up optimization scripts
** 9/26/19 describes algorithm 
*** scripts were in dend_edits subdir -- now on local machine in archive/A1_archive --> unzip this directory
*** dang, this is empty -- go on github for prev version? 
*** went to github, found and copied in the following files to A1/cells/tINT:
**** overlay_ACTIVE.py, overlay_PASSIVE.py
**** netParams_OLD.py, netParams_NEW.py
**** test_cell.py 
** Algorithm:
*** netParams_OLD.py imports sTI_large.hoc
*** netParams_NEW.py imports sTI.hoc
*** Looked at params; the following should be modified in sTI.hoc:
**** PASSIVE:
***** soma 'cm'
***** soma Pass (from ntleak.mod): g_Pass or erev_Pass 
***** dend (if needed): cm, g_Pass, erev_Pass 
**** ACTIVE: 
***** CURRENTLY TBD
*** Added in lines corresponding to the above in netParams_NEW.py 
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['geom']['cm'] = # ORIG: 1
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['Pass']['g'] = # ORIG: 18e-6
#netParams.cellParams['sTI_reduced']['secs']['soma']['mechs']['Pass']['erev'] =  # ORIG: -72.5
* <2019-11-26 Tue -- thal interneurom model active fitting>
** Added passive params (listed below) from fitting into sTI.hoc file
*** (in soma) g_Pass = 0.00015
*** (in soma) erev_Pass = -75
*** v_init set to -65 for both soma and dend; don't know how to initialize this in a hoc file, but luckily that is the default. won't experiment, for time's sake. 
** Active algorithm (described in 9/26 entry) 
*** Use test_int.py to find rheobase

**** what channel? doesn't say 
**** guessing it is fast sodium 
*** kdr2 --> kdr2.mod
**** what channel? doesn't say
**** guessing slow potassium? dr --> delayed rectifier? 
*** Pass --> leak, ntleak.mod

*** iahp --> Slow Ca2+-dependent K+ current (slow AHP), Iahp.mod
*** ican --> Slow Ca2+-dependent cation current, Ican.mod
*** iar --> Anomalous rectifier Ih (*this is HCN then?), ntlh.mod 
** Channels to adjust for bursting:
*** HCN:
**** iar (ntlh.mod) --> HCN -- anomalous rectifier Ih 
*** L-type:
**** *RECALL: L-type --> high-threshold Ca2+ current
**** ical (IL.mod)
**** ical2 (IL3.mod) 
*** T-type:
**** *RECALL: T-type --> LTS (low-threshold spikes) 
**** it2 (ntt.mod) 
** Adjusting T-type channels:
*** it2 (ntt.mod)
*** gcabar_it2 = 4.0e-4 (in sTI.hoc) 
*** gcabar = 0.024 (mho/cm2, in ntt.mod) 
** Adjusting Ican 
*** mechanism --> ican; Ican.mod

* <2019-12-05 Thu -- thal interneuron model>
** Tried inserting BK channel into soma (KC2) -- didn't help 
** looking at ntt.mod equations:
*** m_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v+shift1+50)/4.8])
**** so if m is activation and m_inf is steady state probability of activation, then I want it to be more likely to activate at a higher voltage than it is now
**** right now, shift1 = 7 (or 10)
**** if shift1 = 7:
***** m_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v + 57)/4.8])
***** meaning there's 0.5 chance of activation at v = -57mV 
***** there is ~100% chance of activation as v goes above -57mV 
***** there is ~0% chance of activation as v goes below -57mV 
*** h_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[(v+shift2+78) / 4.6])
**** so if shift2 = 0 like it does now
**** h_inf = 1 / (1 + e^[(v+78) / 4.6])
**** so if v = -78 --> h_inf = 0.5 chance of inactivation 
**** if v = -100 --> h_inf = closer to 1, as voltage decreases below -78
**** if v = +20 --> h_inf = closer to 0, as voltage increases above -78
*** I want "% inactivation" to move towards 0 as potential decreases --> or do I? 
*** I want "% activation" to move towards 1 as potential increases 
 
*** Now, what I want to change is for the % inactivation to go to 0 at a higher voltage than -78. 

*** figure out when they're ~0 and when they intersect to determine window current for these channels 
**** m_inf = ~0 when:
***** 0 = 1 / (1 + e^[-(v+shift1+50)/4.8])
***** epsilon = 1 / (1 + e^-x) --> epsilon * (1 + e^-x) = 1 --> 
***** epsilon + epsilon * (e^-x) = 1 --> epsilon * (e^-x) = ~1 --> 
***** e^-x = (1-epsilon) / epsilon --> -x = ~10 (8, 13, etc.)
***** x = -10 (ish)
***** (v + shift1 + 50) / 4.8 = -10 (ish) 
***** v + shift1 + 50 = -50 (ish)
***** v + shift1 = -100 (ish) --> this is when % activation is close to 0, when v = -100-shift1
**** when is % activation 0.5? --> when v + shift1 + 50 = 0 --> v + shift1 = -50 --> v = -50-shift1
**** when is % activation closer to 1? --> 
*****  m_inf = 1 / 1+e^-x --> when x gets very very large 
***** x = v+ shift1 + 50 --> let's say e^-10 = epsilon
***** (v + shift1 + 50) / 4.8 = 10 --> v + shift1 + 50 = 50 --> v + shift1 = 0 --> v = -shift1
